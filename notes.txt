Look in the exercises_app application in the coderslab project.
There you will find a Band model that contains information about rock bands.
 You will find two fields defined there:
 name - band name, and year - year the band was formed.

Add the following fields there:

still_active: whether the band is still active.
The field should take a boolean type, default value True.
genre: integer type field that should take values:
-1: not defined,
0: rock,
1: metal,
2: pop,
3: hip-hop,
4: electronic,
5: reggae,
6: other.
The field should take the value -1 by default.

Hint: Use the choices parameter. You can find more in the Snippets section.
